        <h2>About Mayapur </h2>
        <p class="text">
            Mayapur is a neighbourhood of Bamanpukur, in the Nabadwip CD block in the Krishnanagar Sadar subdivision of the Nadia district in the state of West Bengal, India.
          <br /><br />
          Mayapur is one of the nine dhams of the holy islands, which look like petals of a lotus flower. The main attraction in the city is the Chandrodaya Temple, which is the first shrine established by ISKCON in the area. Tourists can also pay their respects at the samadhi of Prabhupada, who was the founder of ISKCON.
          From souvenirs of all varieties—Krishna idols, trinkets, prayer tools, and books—to fresh flowers and clothes, the city's markets offer a rich range of items any visitor will find rewarding to look through.

          <h4>The History</h4>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) was founded by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami (Srila Prabhupada) in the West in 1966. ISKCON belongs to Gaudiya (refers to Bengal) Vaishnavism, a devotional tradition based on the teachings of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam.

            The precepts and practices of ISKCON were taught and codified by the 15th century saint and religious reformer Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu (1486-1532), his brother Nityananda Prabhu and six of his principle associates, the Goswamis of Vrindavana (Sanatana, Rupa, Jiva, Gopal Bhatta, Raghunatha Dasa and Raghunatha Bhatta.)
          <br /><br />
          The Bhagavad-gita was first put into writing about 5000 years ago. The Gita is the principal scripture of The Hare Krishna Movement™ Organization. Its origins are more than 5000-years-old.
